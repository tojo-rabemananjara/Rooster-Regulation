# Rooster-Regulation
## Introduction
The goal of this project was to practice writing automated tests using Mocha. Automated tests are better than manual testing in the long run because they can do regression testing to check that existing features do not break with the introduction of new code. This is part of the Test Driven Development series of full-stack development.

## Technology
* Node
* Javascript
* Mocha (for testing)

## Launch
* `npm test`
